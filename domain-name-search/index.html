<p>Yup, domain names are very important for every business, project or idea
you want to spread on the Internet. Many people spend a log of energy
on finding the perfect name only to find out that the relevant “.com” domain has been taken.
It is not a surprise South Park has an episode on that.</p>

<p>There are three major ways to perform a <strong>domain name search</strong> and see if
the domain you are looking for is FREE.</p>

<h2 id="first---check-the-domain-availability-directly-on-your-domain-name-registrar">First - check the domain availability directly on your domain name registrar</h2>

<p>This is the go-to method for most people. It is the most direct and works in general.
Why “in general”? Because you should trust your <a href="https://www.saashub.com/best-domain-name-registrar-software" target="_blank">domain name registrar</a>.
It is not easy to prove; however, it is believed that some registrars are involved
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting" target="_blank">Cybersquatting</a>. You can read
this relevant thread on Hacker News - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24506303" target="_blank">Tell HN: Never search for domains on Godaddy.com</a>.
What is happening is that you search for your shiny new domain name, it is FREE,
but you decide to postpone buying it immediately.
However, a few days later, when you have mustered up the enthusiasm to buy the name,
you find out that your name is already taken. Believe me, it’s a very saddening feeling.</p>

<p>The tricky part is that by using their search, registrars KNOW which
domain names you are interested in as well as the trendy names
that people, on the whole, are looking for. So, they have the data and means to
buy those domains and then try reselling them for more (Cybersquatting).
Of course, if they are caught doing that, it could be detrimental to their business.
That’s why I still believe that most registrars are not doing it.
Yet you never know.</p>

<h2 id="second---check-availability-through-a-third-party-service">Second - check availability through a third-party service</h2>

<p>This is one of the options I’ve been using from time to time. These are utility services
that make money when they refer you to the domain name registrars. For example,
<a href="https://www.namebounce.com/" target="_blank">NameBounce</a> and its <a href="https://www.saashub.com/namebounce-alternatives" target="_blank">alternatives</a>
can generate a few dozens of free domain names based on a keyword.
In my opinion, this is a bit safer as long as you use a generic keyword.
In most cases the base “keyword.com” will be taken but you will be given a list of
dozens of other free options (e.g. Keyword<b>Life</b>.com <b>Max</b>Keyword.com, etc)
So, whoever knows that you have interest in <em>keyword.com</em>, they can’t know which of
the other hundred options you’ve decided to use. Moreover, it will be very expensive
to grab all of them.</p>

<h2 id="third---go-bare-metal-and-ask-the-official-whois-database">Third - go “bare metal” and ask the official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS" target="_blank">WHOIS</a> database.</h2>

<p>This is not the most straightforward option, but it is <strong>the most secure way to perform
a <em>domain name search</em></strong> and check if a name is available. What you have to do is
opening a terminal typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whois my-domain-name.com</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whois -v my-domain-name.com</code> if using Windows)
and reading/interpreting the results.</p>

<p>In the response from the server, you can find out who and when registered the name
and if it is free. There are two inconveniences following this approach. You
have to read all the data (a few screens) that was returned and learn to read it.
That may take some time if you don’t have experience. If the name is free,
somewhere at the end of the whois-response,
there will be a line like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No match for domain "SAASHUB123.COM".</code>.
Then, when you decide, just go and register the domain.</p>

<p>As this third option is my preferred approach for checking names, I’ve been using
a simple bash script that automates the boring parts. You can copy-paste it
from this Github gist - <a href="https://gist.github.com/StanBright/b236675e272ace1b385a9a0f2d543a1f" target="_blank">domain_check.sh</a>.
To set it up, copy that script to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/bin</code> directory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod 755 ~/domain-check.sh</code> and list
all extensions (separated by a space) in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DOMAINS=( '.com' '.io' )</code> section.</p>

<p>Then checking for an available name is as simple as opening your terminal, and
you don’t have to worry that someone will register the same name tomorrow.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>stan@StansMacBook15:~$ domain_check.sh saashub123
saashub123.com - available
saashub123.io - available
</code></pre></div></div>

And remember to follow “<a href="/3-day-rule">The 3 day domain name rule</a>”
before buying any new names.</p>
