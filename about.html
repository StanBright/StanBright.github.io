<p>My name is Stanislav Bozhkov (online - Stan Bright).
I‚Äôm a Bulgarian that lives in Sydney, Australia.
I think that Bulgaria is a great place to grow up
and Sydney (and Australia in general) is the best place to live on the whole.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a software engineer / entrepreneur. I tweet as <a href="https://twitter.com/StanBright">@StanBright</a>
and you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanislavb/">LinkedIn</a>, too.
I‚Äôm passioned about software development, automation, productivity, business, philosophy,
good books, healthy and active livestyle and building products that improve people‚Äôs lives.
I consider myself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">polymath</a>‚Ä¶ yet I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm a lifetime away of becoming one.</p>

<p>The best way to contact me is by sending an email to <a href="mailto:stan@stanbright.com">stan@stanbright.com</a>
or on twitter.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="/now">now page</a>.</p>

<p>The paragraphs below are ordered in reverse hronological order.</p>

<h2 id="starting-up-again-2019">Starting (up) again (2019)</h2>

<p>After moving to Australia, I started work at a local payment processor - <a href="https://www.fatzebra.com/">Fat Zebra</a>.
A great and boostraped start-up. I spent two years there working as seniour software engineer (Ruby on Rails).
I had great time there but at some point I started having the aspirations of working
on my own ideas. Again. Full-time. So, around the middle of 2019 I quit FZ and
started working full-time on my side-projects SaaSHub &amp; LibHunt.</p>

<h2 id="moved-to-sydney-australia-2017">Moved to Sydney, Australia (2017)</h2>

<p>I think around 2014 I got the idea of moving to a ‚Äúbetter place‚Äù. I did some research
where could be the best place to live (for me).
Long story short - I moved to Australia with my girlfriend/partner in Jan 2017.
Neither of us had put feet in Oz before that.</p>

<p>I think that Sydney, Australia is the best place to live with great work-life balance,
plenty of opportunities, great people, amazing climate and almost everything.
The only downside it being too far from the rest of the world (which is an upside as well in some cases).</p>

<h2 id="receipt-bank-and-side-projects-2010">Receipt Bank and side-projects (2010)</h2>

<p>I wanted to start something by myself. So, I tried freelancing and working
on some side projects. Just a few months after leaving svejo.net, I got contacted
by <a href="https://www.receipt-bank.com">Receipt Bank</a> (it was named ‚ÄòReceipt Farm‚Äô at that point).
A UK based company had bought a simple SaaS software based on Ruby on Rails and had
great ideas how to develop it. However, they had a small team of Java developers based in Sofia, Bulgaria.
I was introduced as an external consultant to help the team with my Ruby on Rails experience.
I hadn‚Äôt planned for that but my relationship with <strong>Receipt Bank</strong> lasted 5 years!
I simply loved working with both the founders in London and team in Bulgaria.
Again, I had amazing experience and learned and contributed a lot. Two of my bigger projects
there were building their billing system and the extraction engine (ML) that extracts
all key attributes of a random receipt or invoice.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while working for Receipt Bank, I started two side projects that
I‚Äôm maintaining and developing as of 2020 - <a href="/projects/libhunt">LibHunt</a> &amp; <a href="/projects/saashub">SaaSHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="first-entrepreneurship-endeavours-2007">First entrepreneurship endeavours (2007)</h2>

<p>A friend of mine and I built the biggest link-sharing
social network in Bulgaria - <a href="/projects/svejo">svejo.net</a>. It was, more or less, a Digg.com clone with some
differences and focused on the local blogging community. Facebook and twitter
didn‚Äôt exist at that point. Developing that project from the grownd up was the best
experience I could get as a 20-something boy. At its peak, the project had about 3M monthly visits
(that was big for a country of 7M).</p>

<h2 id="some-random-early-age-facts--2007">Some random early-age facts (&lt; 2007)</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve been dealing with computers since 14 years old. The high school I studied in
was built to support the micro-processors factory next door.
So, I learned the basics of both programming and how hardware works (CPUs, memory, mainboards, etc) relatively early in my life.</p>

<p>I used to be a president of a students company (‚ÄúFuture Star‚Äù) through one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Achievement">Junior Achievement</a>‚Äôs programs. We were baking and selling peanut butter cookies and organizing parties.</p>
