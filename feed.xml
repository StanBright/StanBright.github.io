And, of course, account that everything will take longer than we want it. Most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I started building a “simple” job board - &lt;a href=&quot;https://99remotejobs.com&quot;&gt;99remotejobs.com&lt;/a&gt;.
I thought it would take me a week. It took me a month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short post was supposed to take me only 15 minutes, of couse, yet it took me 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saashub.com&quot;&gt;SaaSHub&lt;/a&gt; I though AND CALCULATED that
if the project had 10,000 visitors a day, I would be all set - making enough
passive income to have a comfortable life. That was naive. It will take much more.
For example, the project has about 8,000 visitors a day today (80% of my initial target),
and it is making only 15% of my target.
But that is OK. I keep pushing forward - every Day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Wisdom" /><summary type="html">It always takes more time …to lose weight …to gain weight …to build good habits …to get rid of bad habits …to arrive on time …to finish the project on time …to reach your goal …for your project to start making money</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Marcus Aurelius on Pragmatism</title><link href="https://stanbright.com/marcus-aurelius-pragmatism/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Marcus Aurelius on Pragmatism" /><published>2020-09-14T23:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-14T23:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://stanbright.com/marcus-aurelius-pragmatism</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stanbright.com/marcus-aurelius-pragmatism/">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic&quot;&gt;The Daily Stoic&lt;/a&gt;”
for the last 2 years. Almost every day. To me, that’s one of the best ways to
jump-start my days, and it takes only a few minutes. I can easily say that
it’s become a habit already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are three of my highlighted quotes by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius&quot;&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; on Pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with where the world is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do now what nature demands of you. Get right to it if that’s in your power.
Don’t look around to see if people will know about it. Don’t await the perfection
of Plato’s &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;, but be satisfied with even the smallest step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything can be an advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Just as nature of rational things has given to each person their rational powers,
so it also gives us this power - just as nature turns to its own purpose any obstacle
or any opposition, so any rational person can convert any obstacle into the raw
material for their own purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t sweat the small stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is essential for you to remember that the attention you give to any action
should be in due proportion to its worth, for then you won’t tire and give up,
if you aren’t busying yourself with lesser things beyond what should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being exceptionally wise and one of the most quoted stoics, Marcus Aurelius
was amongst the longest-reigning Roman emperors (19 years). As a perspective,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors&quot;&gt;many emperors&lt;/a&gt;
lasted between a few months and a few years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Quotes" /><summary type="html">I’ve been reading “The Daily Stoic” for the last 2 years.

take part in various affiliate and referral programs. To be honest, some
of them seemed decent and applicable to SaaSHub. For example, a VPN service.
If we take the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saashub.com/best-vpn-software&quot;&gt;Best VPN Software&lt;/a&gt;” page,
it is quite suitable for including an affiliate link to a relevant VPN service.
SaaSHub could drive a few sales, and I could make some additional money. Perfect.
Well, it is a bit more complicated than that, at least to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, yes, I may make a hundred dollars through a particular affiliate program;
however, each product will require separate management, accounting and collecting
the money through a different channel. The overhead and admin will be more than
I can afford in regards to time and energy. It is just not viable at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I will always be trying to be as objective as possible with the product
lists on SaaSHub. However, if there were affiliate links and the relevant disclosures,
many people will start questioning how genuine the ordering of the products is.
In essence, the cost of using affiliate links would be losing some trust
even if you are trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My “workaround” is offering a self-service and very affordable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saashub.com/featured-products&quot;&gt;product promo&lt;/a&gt;. It is that easy. As long as a product has been approved on SaaSHub,
it can be promoted for $99/month. That subscription fee is nothing for the marketing
budges of most SaaS products, and they can easily test whether it works for them.
At the end of the month, there are no additional admin costs and I get one single
payment from one source instead of 50 payments from 50 distinct sources arriving
in 28 different days (if I were using affiliates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I don’t think that affiliate and referral programs are bad or dishonest.
If one discloses them and doesn’t promote “fake” products, they could possibly
be a viable revenue stream.
They just don’t work for SaaShub and me and now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Business" /><summary type="html">During the last year, I’ve been approached on a regular basis with requests to take part in various affiliate and referral programs.

&lt;p&gt;This has always been one of my favourite Will Smith’s speeches. It’s short
and powerful. If you haven’t listened to it, please do. Now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will transcribe it here, so it stays written down for posterity.&lt;br /&gt;
Here it is - &lt;strong&gt;Will Smith’s wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key to life is running and reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why running?&lt;/strong&gt; When you are running, there is a &lt;em&gt;little person&lt;/em&gt; that talks to you,
and that little person says “Oh, I’m tired, my lungs are going to pop, I’m so hurt,
I’m so tired, there’s no way I could possibly continue.”. And YOU want to quit.
That person, if you learn how to defeat that person when you are running,
you will learn how to not quit when things get hard in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why reading?&lt;/strong&gt; The reason that reading is so important - there’ve been millions
and billions and gazillions of people that have lived before all of us.
There’s no new problem you could have - with your parents, with school… with anything.
There’s no new problem that someone hasn’t already solved and wrote about it in a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, as a person working in tech, I know that there are problems
that are new and people haven’t written about them. Yet, “reading” helps us solve unsolved problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BONUS: Running makes you fit and happier. It makes you more productive in general.&lt;br /&gt;
BONUS2: For more motivation about running, I’d recommend listening/reading

We just have to be actively looking for them.
And we should be prepared to be able to catch the moment when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a local Sushi place recently. Nothing exciting, however, instead of
writing down my name and contacts on a piece of paper, I was asked to simply
scan a barcode and fill in a very simple and unobtrusive form. Easy. Here in
Australia, restaurants are required to keep a record of the who and when visited
their spot so that if a COVID-19 case shows up, they can do a more effective
contact tracking. OK, a few days later, I went to a different restaurant and was
asked to scan a barcode again and enter my details. They were using
the same service as my details were prefilled. All I had to do was click
a big centred green button. How convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home, I was thinking about how this service was built specifically to cater to
the needs around COVID. It was very simple and ALL restaurants around Australia and New Zealand,
have to comply with this new requirement. I checked the website of the service,
a SaaS product, its entry price was $19 per month, and they stated that 60,000
businesses around Aus and NZ were using them! That’d be around $120,000 per month
for a simple check-in app. Of course, you will have to spend some money on marketing
and effort on your go-to-market strategy, yet it’s a perfect example of catching the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, and I imagine many other makers, can easily build such a simple service in a month.
Even better, a team of a technical and a sales person could bootstrap such a business
quite easily should they see the opportunity and execute quickly enough. Yes,
this requirement won’t last forever; however, I’m sure that many founders wouldn’t
mind making a million dollars in a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that similar opportunities show up all the time. All it takes is being
prepared so that you can execute quickly enough when you notice them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Ideas" /><summary type="html">There are great opportunities - all the time.

or thousands of dollars - “The 3 Day Domain Name Rule”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whenever you have an idea of a great domain name,
wait for 3 days, at least, before buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that simple. However, be warned, there might be an uneasy feeling
that someone is going to grab the domain before you. It will be haunting you
on the back of your mind. You have to resist it and stick to the rule.
Both your future self and your money will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you could be thinking “&lt;em&gt;But, it’s only $8.95&lt;/em&gt;”. Yet, &lt;strong&gt;it’s more&lt;/strong&gt;. Usually, a few times more.
Let me tell you why. We, people, hate losing things that we own.
Hence, once you own the domain and have put your credit card in, it is very very likely
you will be paying for that name for a few years. Domain registrars
are aware of that, too. That’s why the registration price, on many platforms, is
%30 - %50 less compared to the following up renewals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is an example with GoDaddy: Reg $12; Renewal: $18 (+50%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/3-day-rule/godaddy-dotcom-price-2020.png&quot; alt=&quot;3-day-rule/godaddy-dotcom-price-2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say that you will keep your shiny new domain, on average, for 3 years at least.&lt;br /&gt;
That makes ~$50!, and NOT $11.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.io&lt;/strong&gt; domains are the worst. First, they are heaps more expensive - $54 to reg it
and $60 to renew =&amp;gt; a $174 &lt;a href=&quot;/idea-ownership-cost&quot;&gt;idea ownership cost&lt;/a&gt;. What is more,
they seem short, trendy, and many of them are not registered yet. If you are building
a tech product, you will be lured into buying one of those. Do yourself a favour and
either try coming up with a &lt;strong&gt;.com&lt;/strong&gt; name or at least apply the rule and don’t rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, back to the rule. At some point, after buying many domains and losing some money,
I realised that my enthusiasm for the “great” idea I had the day before would
start disappering more often than not. Only the “good” ideas stuck for longer than a few days.
Then, I came with this rule of thumb for myself - never buy a domain name without waiting for
at least 3 days after coming up with the idea of it. I’ve never had a single case when
someone else would grab the domain before me. NEVER. The closest one was about 3 months afer I had the idea.
The domain name was &lt;em&gt;vivanotes.com&lt;/em&gt; if you are curious. To be honest, it felt a bit bad,
as I still had the idea written down in my notes. Yet, I will most probably never build
that project and have saved hundreds or thousands of dollars along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why 3 days&lt;/strong&gt;? There is no scientific reason! It’s easy to remember, it’s longer than a weekend
and it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Ideas" /><summary type="html">I will share one of my little “secrets” that have saved me hundreds or thousands of dollars - “The 3 Day Domain Name Rule”.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Why” questions and why to avoid them</title><link href="https://stanbright.com/why-questions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“Why” questions and why to avoid them" /><published>2020-09-09T07:11:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-09T07:11:00+10:00</updated><id>https://stanbright.com/why-questions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stanbright.com/why-questions/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. &lt;strong&gt;“Why” is always an accusation&lt;/strong&gt;, in any language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advice of avoiding “why questions” is from the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference&quot;&gt;“Never Split The Difference”&lt;/a&gt;
by Chris Voss. If we think about it, how straight to the point is that?
When was the last time someone asked you
“Why this” or “Why that” and you weren’t left with a bit of sour feeling.
For example, many bosses would use “why questions” in meetings after something
had gone wrong (&lt;em&gt;“Why did you do that”, “Why didn’t we sell enough”, “Why couldn’t we release on time”, etc.&lt;/em&gt;).
However, that might be counterproductive in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better alternative is asking calibrated and open-ended questions that direct
the other person towards solving your problem. Such could be “How” or “What” -
&lt;em&gt;“How can we solve this problem?”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“What can we do to improve the process?”&lt;/em&gt;, etc.
Coming up with these non-why questions will lead to better results for both parties
in most cases. Moreover, they may start flowing naturally to you once you remember
to avoid “why questions” in negotiations as a rule of thumb.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Wisdom" /><category term="Books" /><category term="Never Split The Difference" /><category term="Negotiations" /><category term="Advice" /><summary type="html">Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello world</title><link href="https://stanbright.com/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello world" /><published>2020-09-08T09:00:50+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-08T09:00:50+10:00</updated><id>https://stanbright.com/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stanbright.com/hello-world/">&lt;p&gt;I have decided to start blogging again.

Blogging requires consistency, time, dedication and even more.
However, you reap the benefits much later. I guess that’s the reason why many people stop blogging
(apart from moving to walled gardens like Medium, Twitter, LinkedIn, FB, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I’ve been observing a slight renaissance in blogging in the last year or two.
That and the idea that one improves his thinking by writing, made me wanna start blogging again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also had the idea of building an RSS reader.
It has been boiling at the back of my head for almost a year.
I even bought a domain a few months ago. I have the mantra that one should use
what he is building if he wants to make something useful.
I think that taking an active part in the blogging community would be the best
way to experience the genuine needs of an RSS reader user.&lt;/p&gt;
