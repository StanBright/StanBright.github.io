&lt;p&gt;The advice of avoiding “why questions” is from the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference&quot;&gt;“Never Split The Difference”&lt;/a&gt;
by Chris Voss. If we think about it, how straight to the point is that?
When was the last time someone asked you
“Why this” or “Why that” and you weren’t left with a bit of sour feeling.
For example, many bosses would use “why questions” in meetings after something
had gone wrong (&lt;em&gt;“Why did you do that”, “Why didn’t we sell enough”, “Why couldn’t we release on time”, etc.&lt;/em&gt;).
However, that might be counterproductive in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better alternative is asking calibrated and open-ended questions that direct
the other person towards solving your problem. Such could be “How” or “What” -
&lt;em&gt;“How can we solve this problem?”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“What can we do to improve the process?”&lt;/em&gt;, etc.
Coming up with these non-why questions will lead to better results for both parties
in most cases. Moreover, they may start flowing naturally to you once you remember
to avoid “why questions” in negotiations as a rule of thumb.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Wisdom" /><category term="Books" /><category term="Never Split The Difference" /><category term="Negotiations" /><category term="Advice" /><summary type="html">Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello world</title><link href="http://localhost:4001/blog/hello-world" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello world" /><published>2020-09-08T09:00:50+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-08T09:00:50+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4001/blog/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4001/blog/hello-world">I have decided to start blogging again.

Blogging requires consistency, time, dedication and even more.
However, you reap the benefits much later. I guess that’s the reason why many people stop blogging
(apart from moving to walled gardens like Medium, Twitter, LinkedIn, FB, etc.).

Yet, I’ve been observing a slight renaissance in blogging in the last year or two.
That and the idea that one improves his thinking by writing, made me wanna start blogging again.

I have also had the idea of building an RSS reader.
It has been boiling at the back of my head for almost a year.
I even bought a domain a few months ago. I have the mantra that one should use
what he is building if he wants to make something useful.
I think that taking an active part in the blogging community would be the best
way to experience the genuine needs of an RSS reader user.

So, let’s see what happens.</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Meta" /><summary type="html">I have decided to start blogging again.
