That is quite obvious at pro-level sports disciplines - the moment you lose focus, your opponent takes advantage and scores.
In the end of the day, if you want to be a ‚Äúpro‚Äù in any discipline, you need to learn how to sustain your focus for long periods of time.
Always being present and in the now. I came to this realisation while watching the Australian Open finals this year.
I guess that‚Äôs also amongst the reasons why the crowd could play a vital role in most games.
It could be both a distracting and a ‚Äúget yourself together‚Äù force for players on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately&lt;/strong&gt;, that seems to be valid for everything we do in our lives and everything we work on.
Why ‚Äúunfortunately‚Äù? Well, as it isn‚Äôt obvious.
We don‚Äôt always have that opponent waiting for our mistake to score. So we lose track.
And we lose focus very easily without any apparent repercussions.
Then, we still want to be pro and play the majors, and we wonder why that isn‚Äôt happening. It also happens that we blame external circumstances. At the same time,
the simple truth is that we just can‚Äôt sustain our focus at a pro-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortunately&lt;/strong&gt;, that is something that we have control over, and as long as we are willing to develop that skill - we can play the majors. In any discipline.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Wisdom" /><category term="Wisdom" /><category term="Focus" /><category term="Thoughts" /><summary type="html">Loss of focus, even for a moment, is always detrimental to what we are doing.

The challenge was to score 10,000 steps per day in September.
You form teams of four, keep one-another accountable, compete with others
and along the way, raise some money for charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, there were three big benefits of taking part in it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health&lt;/strong&gt;. Undeniably, walking more will keep you in better shape than sitting in front of the computer all day. Taking part in such a challenge forces you to get out and move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charity&lt;/strong&gt;. It always makes you feel good when you do something for others. It‚Äôs one of the best win-win things people can do. First, you help someone and then - you feel better because of that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social and more offline time&lt;/strong&gt;. I spent some extra time with friends and had some extra walks in nature, away from the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize&lt;/strong&gt;: I did 10,000+ steps every day in September with an average of 12,683 steps/day!
That‚Äôs more than double my usual daily average of 5,800.
I‚Äôm sure this has positively contributed to my health and wellbeing.
Also, our mighty team of four -

    &lt;p&gt;Was the time I spent writing my RSS scripts more than the time I would now spend thinking about the ‚Äúbest‚Äù RSS aggregator and reader? Doesn‚Äôt matter. I enjoyed writing the scripts. I learned new things and got satisfaction out of seeing them run correctly. I get nothing like that out of comparing apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I concur so strongly not only because he writes about RSS, which I‚Äôm on record as supporting and using. I enjoy rolling my own simple software in almost any domain. Simple has a lot of advantages. Under my control has a lot of advantages. But the biggest advantage echoes what Dr. Drang says: Programming is often more fun than the alternative uses of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I program because I like to, and because I can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2020-09.html#e2020-09-22T16_09_19.htm&quot;&gt;Eugene Wallingford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the above this morning and just wanted to chime in.
It resonates so much with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that there are three main reasons why time spent programming is well spent
and joyful (when you are not dealing with ‚Äúbugs‚Äù).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning&quot;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an endless desire to learn, and I genuinely believe that doing is the best
way to learn. I‚Äôve started many toy projects along the years just for the sake of learning.
Two quick examples: long ago, I built the &lt;a href=&quot;http://emojihomepage.com/&quot;&gt;EmojiHomepage&lt;/a&gt; to learn Vue.js;
yesterday, I released &lt;a href=&quot;https://alertcamp.com/live&quot;&gt;Alertcamp Live&lt;/a&gt; for the sake of
learning ‚ÄúPhoenix LiveView‚Äù and practice my &lt;a href=&quot;http://erlang.org/doc/system_architecture_intro/sys_arch_intro.html&quot;&gt;OTP&lt;/a&gt;
knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;control&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building things yourself puts you in control. And we, people, love being in control.
You don‚Äôt like something, you need some quirky additional feature, or
you think something else will work better - it doesn‚Äôt matter, you are in
control, and you can do whatever you want. Sure, there might be some rough edges,
yet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect&quot;&gt;IKEA Effect&lt;/a&gt; will compensate for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creativity&quot;&gt;Creativity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that creating anything is an innate human desire and practising it always
leads to joyful experiences. That includes anything - complex systems, simple scripts,
an article posted online, a wooden box. I‚Äôm sure that any craftsmanship
will bring you more joy than many other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are some excerpts from the relevant Hacker News
&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24564835&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôve worked on a lot of personal projects over the years that were never finished or were quickly abandoned. I used to feel bad about this, feeling like I had wasted my time. But then I realized that I learned a ton by doing all of this work.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;- larrywright&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- So, tell me, how did you land a job on Google?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Yeah, I was trying to redo my website‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I spent countless hours on my side project Video Hub App.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôve learned a great deal, and it‚Äôs immensely satisfying to work on. I‚Äôve explored face recognition and server capabilities (learning a lot and having a good time).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;- yboris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An old colleague tried to convince me that I shouldn‚Äôt write my own job queue last night because ‚Äúit‚Äôs all handled in the cloud‚Äù. It‚Äôs things like this that make me a better programmer whilst also allowing me to run software that does exactly what I want.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, domain names are very important for every business, project or idea
you want to spread on the Internet. Many people spend a log of energy
on finding the perfect name only to find out that the relevant ‚Äú.com‚Äù domain has been taken.
It is not a surprise South Park has an episode on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three major ways to perform a &lt;strong&gt;domain name search&lt;/strong&gt; and see if
the domain you are looking for is FREE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first---check-the-domain-availability-directly-on-your-domain-name-registrar&quot;&gt;First - check the domain availability directly on your domain name registrar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the go-to method for most people. It is the most direct and works in general.
Why ‚Äúin general‚Äù? Because you should trust your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saashub.com/best-domain-name-registrar-software&quot;&gt;domain name registrar&lt;/a&gt;.
It is not easy to prove; however, it is believed that some registrars are involved
in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting&quot;&gt;Cybersquatting&lt;/a&gt;. You can read
this relevant thread on Hacker News - &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24506303&quot;&gt;Tell HN: Never search for domains on Godaddy.com&lt;/a&gt;.
What is happening is that you search for your shiny new domain name, it is FREE,
but you decide to postpone buying it immediately.
However, a few days later, when you have mustered up the enthusiasm to buy the name,
you find out that your name is already taken. Believe me, it‚Äôs a very saddening feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky part is that by using their search, registrars KNOW which
domain names you are interested in as well as the trendy names
that people, on the whole, are looking for. So, they have the data and means to
buy those domains and then try reselling them for more (Cybersquatting).
Of course, if they are caught doing that, it could be detrimental to their business.
That‚Äôs why I still believe that most registrars are not doing it.
Yet you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second---check-availability-through-a-third-party-service&quot;&gt;Second - check availability through a third-party service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the options I‚Äôve been using from time to time. These are utility services
that make money when they refer you to the domain name registrars. For example,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.namebounce.com/&quot;&gt;NameBounce&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saashub.com/namebounce-alternatives&quot;&gt;alternatives&lt;/a&gt;
can generate a few dozens of free domain names based on a keyword.
In my opinion, this is a bit safer as long as you use a generic keyword.
In most cases the base ‚Äúkeyword.com‚Äù will be taken but you will be given a list of
dozens of other free options (e.g. Keyword&lt;b&gt;Life&lt;/b&gt;.com &lt;b&gt;Max&lt;/b&gt;Keyword.com, etc)
So, whoever knows that you have interest in &lt;em&gt;keyword.com&lt;/em&gt;, they can‚Äôt know which of
the other hundred options you‚Äôve decided to use. Moreover, it will be very expensive
to grab all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third---go-bare-metal-and-ask-the-official-whois-database&quot;&gt;Third - go ‚Äúbare metal‚Äù and ask the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS&quot;&gt;WHOIS&lt;/a&gt; database.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the most straightforward option, but it is &lt;strong&gt;the most secure way to perform
a &lt;em&gt;domain name search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and check if a name is available. What you have to do is
opening a terminal typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;whois my-domain-name.com&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;whois -v my-domain-name.com&lt;/code&gt; if using Windows)
and reading/interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the response from the server, you can find out who and when registered the name
and if it is free. There are two inconveniences following this approach. You
have to read all the data (a few screens) that was returned and learn to read it.
That may take some time if you don‚Äôt have experience. If the name is free,
somewhere at the end of the whois-response,
there will be a line like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No match for domain &quot;SAASHUB123.COM&quot;.&lt;/code&gt;.
Then, when you decide, just go and register the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this third option is my preferred approach for checking names, I‚Äôve been using
a simple bash script that automates the boring parts. You can copy-paste it
from this Github gist - &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/StanBright/b236675e272ace1b385a9a0f2d543a1f&quot;&gt;domain_check.sh&lt;/a&gt;.
To set it up, copy that script to your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chmod 755 ~/domain-check.sh&lt;/code&gt; and list
all extensions (separated by a space) in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DOMAINS=( '.com' '.io' )&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then checking for an available name is as simple as opening your terminal, and
you don‚Äôt have to worry that someone will register the same name tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;stan@StansMacBook15:~$ domain_check.sh saashub123
saashub123.com - available
saashub123.io - available
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And remember to follow ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;/3-day-rule&quot;&gt;The 3 day domain name rule&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù
before buying any new names.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Tech" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">It always takes more time</title><link href="https://stanbright.com/longer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="It always takes more time" /><published>2020-09-15T22:47:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-15T22:47:00+10:00</updated><id>https://stanbright.com/longer</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stanbright.com/longer/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It always takes more time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶to lose weight&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶to gain weight&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶to build good habits&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶to get rid of bad habits&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶to arrive on time&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶to finish the project on time&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶to reach your goal&lt;br /&gt;
‚Ä¶for your project to start making money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that is OK&lt;/strong&gt;. All we have to do is push forward. Every day. Giving our all.
And account that everything will take longer than we want it. Most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I started building a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù job board - &lt;a href=&quot;https://99remotejobs.com&quot;&gt;99remotejobs.com&lt;/a&gt;.
I thought it would take me a week. It took a month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short post was supposed to take me only 15 minutes, of course, yet it took 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saashub.com&quot;&gt;SaaSHub&lt;/a&gt; I though AND CALCULATED that
if the project had 10,000 visitors a day, I would be all set - making enough
passive income to have a comfortable life. That was naive. It will take much more.
The project has about 8,000 visitors a day today (80% of my initial target),
and it is making only 15% of my target.
But that is OK. I keep pushing forward - every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story - be prepared both psychologically and financially that
our endeavours will take more time. If you are pressed to give an end date of a
project, multiply by 2 your initial guess (yes, it is a guess) and then
extend it a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Wisdom" /><summary type="html">It always takes more time ‚Ä¶to lose weight ‚Ä¶to gain weight ‚Ä¶to build good habits ‚Ä¶to get rid of bad habits ‚Ä¶to arrive on time ‚Ä¶to finish the project on time ‚Ä¶to reach your goal ‚Ä¶for your project to start making money</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Marcus Aurelius on Pragmatism</title><link href="https://stanbright.com/marcus-aurelius-pragmatism/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Marcus Aurelius on Pragmatism" /><published>2020-09-14T23:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-14T23:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://stanbright.com/marcus-aurelius-pragmatism</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stanbright.com/marcus-aurelius-pragmatism/">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been reading ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic&quot;&gt;The Daily Stoic&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù

jump-start my days, and it takes only a few minutes. I can easily say that
it‚Äôs become a habit already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are three of my highlighted quotes by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius&quot;&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; on Pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with where the world is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do now what nature demands of you. Get right to it if that‚Äôs in your power.
Don‚Äôt look around to see if people will know about it. Don‚Äôt await the perfection
of Plato‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Republic&lt;/em&gt;, but be satisfied with even the smallest step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything can be an advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Just as nature of rational things has given to each person their rational powers,
so it also gives us this power - just as nature turns to its own purpose any obstacle
or any opposition, so any rational person can convert any obstacle into the raw
material for their own purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don‚Äôt sweat the small stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is essential for you to remember that the attention you give to any action
should be in due proportion to its worth, for then you won‚Äôt tire and give up,
if you aren‚Äôt busying yourself with lesser things beyond what should be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being exceptionally wise and one of the most quoted stoics, Marcus Aurelius
was amongst the longest-reigning Roman emperors (19 years). As a perspective,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors&quot;&gt;many emperors&lt;/a&gt;

however, each product will require separate management, accounting and collecting
the money through a different channel. The overhead and admin will be more than
I can afford in regards to time and energy. It is just not viable at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I will always be trying to be as objective as possible with the product
lists on SaaSHub. However, if there were affiliate links and the relevant disclosures,
many people will start questioning how genuine the ordering of the products is.
In essence, the cost of using affiliate links would be losing some trust
even if you are trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ‚Äúworkaround‚Äù is offering a self-service and very affordable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saashub.com/featured-products&quot;&gt;product promo&lt;/a&gt;. It is that easy. As long as a product has been approved on SaaSHub,
it can be promoted for $99/month. That subscription fee is nothing for the marketing
budges of most SaaS products, and they can easily test whether it works for them.
At the end of the month, there are no additional admin costs and I get one single
payment from one source instead of 50 payments from 50 distinct sources arriving
in 28 different days (if I were using affiliates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I don‚Äôt think that affiliate and referral programs are bad or dishonest.
If one discloses them and doesn‚Äôt promote ‚Äúfake‚Äù products, they could possibly
be a viable revenue stream.
They just don‚Äôt work for SaaShub and me and now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Business" /><summary type="html">During the last year, I‚Äôve been approached on a regular basis with requests to take part in various affiliate and referral programs. To be honest, some of them seemed decent and applicable to SaaSHub. For example, a VPN service. If we take the ‚ÄúBest VPN Software‚Äù page, it is quite suitable for including an affiliate link to a relevant VPN service. SaaSHub could drive a few sales, and I could make some additional money. Perfect. Well, it is a bit more complicated than that, at least to me.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Running and Reading - the key to life</title><link href="https://stanbright.com/running-and-reading/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Running and Reading - the key to life" /><published>2020-09-12T20:25:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-12T20:25:00+10:00</updated><id>https://stanbright.com/running-and-reading</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stanbright.com/running-and-reading/">&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has always been one of my favourite Will Smith‚Äôs speeches. It‚Äôs short
and powerful. If you haven‚Äôt listened to it, please do. Now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will transcribe it here, so it stays written down for posterity.&lt;br /&gt;
Here it is - &lt;strong&gt;Will Smith‚Äôs wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key to life is running and reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why running?&lt;/strong&gt; When you are running, there is a &lt;em&gt;little person&lt;/em&gt; that talks to you,
and that little person says ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm tired, my lungs are going to pop, I‚Äôm so hurt,
I‚Äôm so tired, there‚Äôs no way I could possibly continue.‚Äù. And YOU want to quit.
That person, if you learn how to defeat that person when you are running,
you will learn how to not quit when things get hard in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why reading?&lt;/strong&gt; The reason that reading is so important - there‚Äôve been millions
and billions and gazillions of people that have lived before all of us.
There‚Äôs no new problem you could have - with your parents, with school‚Ä¶ with anything.
There‚Äôs no new problem that someone hasn‚Äôt already solved and wrote about it in a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, as a person working in tech, I know that there are problems
that are new and people haven‚Äôt written about them. Yet, ‚Äúreading‚Äù helps us solve unsolved problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BONUS: Running makes you fit and happier. It makes you more productive in general.&lt;br /&gt;
BONUS2: For more motivation about running, I‚Äôd recommend listening/reading

We just have to be actively looking for them.
And we should be prepared to be able to catch the moment when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a local Sushi place recently. Nothing exciting, however, instead of
writing down my name and contacts on a piece of paper, I was asked to simply
scan a barcode and fill in a very simple and unobtrusive form. Easy. Here in
Australia, restaurants are required to keep a record of the who and when visited
their spot so that if a COVID-19 case shows up, they can do a more effective
contact tracking. OK, a few days later, I went to a different restaurant and was
asked to scan a barcode again and enter my details. They were using
the same service as my details were prefilled. All I had to do was click
a big centred green button. How convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home, I was thinking about how this service was built specifically to cater to
the needs around COVID. It was very simple and ALL restaurants around Australia and New Zealand,
have to comply with this new requirement. I checked the website of the service,
a SaaS product, its entry price was $19 per month, and they stated that 60,000
businesses around Aus and NZ were using them! That‚Äôd be around $120,000 per month
for a simple check-in app. Of course, you will have to spend some money on marketing
and effort on your go-to-market strategy, yet it‚Äôs a perfect example of catching the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, and I imagine many other makers, can easily build such a simple service in a month.
Even better, a team of a technical and a sales person could bootstrap such a business
quite easily should they see the opportunity and execute quickly enough. Yes,
this requirement won‚Äôt last forever; however, I‚Äôm sure that many founders wouldn‚Äôt
mind making a million dollars in a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that similar opportunities show up all the time. All it takes is being
prepared so that you can execute quickly enough when you notice them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Ideas" /><summary type="html">There are great opportunities - all the time.

or thousands of dollars - ‚ÄúThe 3 Day Domain Name Rule‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whenever you have an idea of a great domain name,
wait for 3 days, at least, before buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs that simple. However, be warned, there might be an uneasy feeling
that someone is going to grab the domain before you. It will be haunting you
on the back of your mind. You have to resist it and stick to the rule.
Both your future self and your money will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you could be thinking ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;But, it‚Äôs only $8.95&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù. Yet, &lt;strong&gt;it‚Äôs more&lt;/strong&gt;. Usually, a few times more.
Let me tell you why. We, people, hate losing things that we own.
Hence, once you own the domain and have put your credit card in, it is very very likely
you will be paying for that name for a few years. Domain registrars
are aware of that, too. That‚Äôs why the registration price, on many platforms, is
%30 - %50 less compared to the following up renewals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is an example with GoDaddy: Reg $12; Renewal: $18 (+50%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/3-day-rule/godaddy-dotcom-price-2020.png&quot; alt=&quot;3-day-rule/godaddy-dotcom-price-2020.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd say that you will keep your shiny new domain, on average, for 3 years at least.&lt;br /&gt;
That makes ~$50!, and NOT $11.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.io&lt;/strong&gt; domains are the worst. First, they are heaps more expensive - $54 to reg it
and $60 to renew =&amp;gt; a $174 &lt;a href=&quot;/idea-ownership-cost&quot;&gt;idea ownership cost&lt;/a&gt;. What is more,
they seem short, trendy, and many of them are not registered yet. If you are building
a tech product, you will be lured into buying one of those. Do yourself a favour and
either try coming up with a &lt;strong&gt;.com&lt;/strong&gt; name or at least apply the rule and don‚Äôt rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, back to the rule. At some point, after buying many domains and losing some money,
I realised that my enthusiasm for the ‚Äúgreat‚Äù idea I had the day before would
start disappering more often than not. Only the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ideas stuck for longer than a few days.
Then, I came with this rule of thumb for myself - never buy a domain name without waiting for
at least 3 days after coming up with the idea of it. I‚Äôve never had a single case when
someone else would grab the domain before me. NEVER. The closest one was about 3 months afer I had the idea.
The domain name was &lt;em&gt;vivanotes.com&lt;/em&gt; if you are curious. To be honest, it felt a bit bad,
as I still had the idea written down in my notes. Yet, I will most probably never build
that project and have saved hundreds or thousands of dollars along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why 3 days&lt;/strong&gt;? There is no scientific reason! It‚Äôs easy to remember, it‚Äôs longer than a weekend
and it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Ideas" /><summary type="html">I will share one of my little ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù that have saved me hundreds or thousands of dollars - ‚ÄúThe 3 Day Domain Name Rule‚Äù.</summary></entry></feed>
