The advice of avoiding &quot;why questions&quot; is from the book [&quot;Never Split The Difference&quot;](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference)
by Chris Voss. If we think about it, how straight to the point is that?
When was the last time someone asked you
&quot;Why this&quot; or &quot;Why that&quot; and you weren't left with a bit of sour feeling.
For example, many bosses would use &quot;why questions&quot; in meetings after something
had gone wrong (_&quot;Why did you do that&quot;, &quot;Why didn't we sell enough&quot;, &quot;Why couldn't we release on time&quot;, etc._).
However, that might be counterproductive in many cases.

The better alternative is asking calibrated and open-ended questions that direct
the other person towards solving your problem. Such could be &quot;How&quot; or &quot;What&quot; -
_&quot;How can we solve this problem?&quot;_, _&quot;What can we do to improve the process?&quot;_, etc.
Coming up with these non-why questions will lead to better results for both parties
in most cases. Moreover, they may start flowing naturally to you once you remember
to avoid &quot;why questions&quot; in negotiations as a rule of thumb.</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Wisdom" /><category term="Books" /><category term="Never Split The Difference" /><category term="Negotiations" /><category term="Advice" /><summary type="html">Don‚Äôt ask questions that start with ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù is always an accusation, in any language.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello world</title><link href="http://localhost:4001/blog/hello-world" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello world" /><published>2020-09-08T09:00:50+10:00</published><updated>2020-09-08T09:00:50+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4001/blog/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4001/blog/hello-world">I have decided to start blogging again.

Blogging requires consistency, time, dedication and even more.
However, you reap the benefits much later. I guess that‚Äôs the reason why many people stop blogging
(apart from moving to walled gardens like Medium, Twitter, LinkedIn, FB, etc.).

Yet, I‚Äôve been observing a slight renaissance in blogging in the last year or two.
That and the idea that one improves his thinking by writing, made me wanna start blogging again.

I have also had the idea of building an RSS reader.
It has been boiling at the back of my head for almost a year.
I even bought a domain a few months ago. I have the mantra that one should use
what he is building if he wants to make something useful.
I think that taking an active part in the blogging community would be the best
way to experience the genuine needs of an RSS reader user.

So, let‚Äôs see what happens.</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Meta" /><summary type="html">I have decided to start blogging again.
