I used to blog relatively regullarly about
10 years ago. More or less, when I was actively developing &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/svejo&quot;&gt;svejo.net&lt;/a&gt;.
Then I stopped. Blogging regularly requires consistency, time, dedication and even more.
However, you reap the benefits much later. I guess that‚Äôs the reason why many people stop blogging
(apart from moving to walled gardens like Medium, Twitter, LinkedIn, FB, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I‚Äôve been observing a slight renaissance in blogging in the last year or two.
That, along with the idea that one improves his thinking by writing, made me wanna
start blogging again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, the idea of building an RSS reader has been boiling
at the back of my head for almost an year. I even bought a domain a few months ago.
I have the mantra that one should use what he is building if he wants to make something useful.
I think that taking an active part in the blogging community would be
the best way to experience the genuine needs of an RSS reader user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let‚Äôs see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Meta" /><summary type="html">I have decided to start blogging again.
